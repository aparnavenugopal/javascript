1.What does Array.prototype.includes() do in js?
A.In JavaScript, Array.prototype.includes() is a method used to check if an array includes a certain element, returning true or false based on the result. It was introduced in ECMAScript 2016 (ES7) and is a convenient alternative to the indexOf() method for simple inclusion checks.

array.includes(element, start)

1.array: The array to be checked.
2.element: The element to search for within the array.
start (Optional): The position in the array at which to begin the search. If omitted, the search starts from index 0.

Return Value:
true if the array contains the specified element, otherwise false.

const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

console.log(array.includes(2)); // Output: true
console.log(array.includes(7)); // Output: false

Note:

1.It works for both primitive types (like numbers, strings, booleans) and reference types (like objects, arrays).
2.It uses strict equality (===) for comparisons. So, if the array contains objects, it checks if the array elements and the specified element refer to the same object.
3.If the second parameter start is provided, includes() will start searching for the element from that index onwards. This feature is useful if you want to skip a portion of the array during the search.
4.It doesn't modify the original array.


Compatibility:

1.Array.prototype.includes() is supported in all modern browsers, but it's not supported in Internet Explorer. If you need compatibility with older browsers, you might need to use a polyfill or alternative methods like indexOf().
