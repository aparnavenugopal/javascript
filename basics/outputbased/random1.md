explanations for all input output questions

    1.To understand the output of this code, it's important to comprehend the JavaScript event loop, along with how setTimeout, Promise, and microtasks work. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what happens when the code runs:

       1.console.log(1); is executed immediately in the main thread, printing 1.

       2.setTimeout(() => console.log(2)); schedules a macro task to print 2 after a delay of 0 milliseconds. This task will go into the task queue to be executed later.

       3.Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(3)); schedules a microtask to print 3. Microtasks are executed right after the currently executing script and before any task from the task queue.

       4.Promise.resolve().then(() => setTimeout(() => console.log(4))); schedules a microtask to set another macro task to print 4 after a delay of 0 milliseconds.

       5.Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(5)); schedules another microtask to print 5.

       6.setTimeout(() => console.log(6)); schedules a macro task to print 6 after a delay of 0 milliseconds.

       7.console.log(7); is executed immediately in the main thread, printing 7.

    2.Now, let's break down the order of execution:

      1.Main Thread Execution:

        console.log(1); → prints 1
        console.log(7); → prints 7
        Microtasks Execution (after the main thread):

        Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(3)); → prints 3
        Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(5)); → prints 5 
        Promise.resolve().then(() => setTimeout(() => console.log(4))); schedules another macro task to print 4.
      2.Macro Tasks Execution (after microtasks):

        setTimeout(() => console.log(2)); → prints 2
        setTimeout(() => console.log(6)); → prints 6
      3.The macro task scheduled by the microtask: setTimeout(() => console.log(4)); → prints 4

problem8:
  1.Synchronous Code Execution:

    The code starts executing synchronously from the top.
    console.log(1); is called, which prints 1.
  2.Definition of Async Function:

    The async function foo is defined, but it is not yet executed.
  3.Execution of Async Function:

    foo(); is called, which starts executing the foo function.
    Inside foo, the first statement is console.log(2);, which prints 2.
  4.Awaiting a Promise:

    The next statement is await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));.
    A new promise is created, and setTimeout is called with a delay of 1000ms (1 second).
    The await keyword pauses the execution of the foo function until the promise is resolved. However, await only pauses the foo function, not the overall script. This means the execution continues to the next lines of code outside the foo function.
  5.Continuing Synchronous Code Execution:

    After calling foo();, the next line is console.log(4);, which prints 4.
  6.Timeout Completion and Promise Resolution:

    After approximately 1 second, the setTimeout callback executes, which calls resolve().
    This resolves the promise that was awaited in the foo function.
    The foo function resumes execution after the await line, and the next statement console.log(3); is executed, printing 3.
  7.Timeline of Execution
    console.log(1); prints 1.
    foo(); starts executing:
    console.log(2); inside foo prints 2.
    Execution pauses at await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));.
    console.log(4); prints 4.
    Approximately 1 second later:
    The promise inside foo is resolved, and foo resumes execution.
    console.log(3); inside foo prints 3.

2.problem 2 of closures

  In this example, we have defined a function makeAdder(x), that takes a single argument x, and returns a new function. The function it returns takes a single argument y, and returns the sum of x and y.

  In essence, makeAdder is a function factory. It creates functions that can add a specific value to their argument. In the above example, the function factory creates two new functions—one that adds five to its argument, and one that adds 10.

  add5 and add10 both form closures. They share the same function body definition, but store different lexical environments. In add5's lexical environment, x is 5, while in the lexical environment for add10, x is 10.

3.problem 3 closures:

Closures are useful because they let you associate data (the lexical environment) with a function that operates on that data. This has obvious parallels to object-oriented programming, where objects allow you to associate data (the object's properties) with one or more methods.

Consequently, you can use a closure anywhere that you might normally use an object with only a single method.

Situations where you might want to do this are particularly common on the web. Much of the code written in front-end JavaScript is event-based. You define some behavior, and then attach it to an event that is triggered by the user (such as a click or a keypress). The code is attached as a callback (a single function that is executed in response to the event).

For instance, suppose we want to add buttons to a page to adjust the text size. One way of doing this is to specify the font-size of the body element (in pixels), and then set the size of the other elements on the page (such as headers) using the relative em

Such interactive text size buttons can change the font-size property of the body element, and the adjustments are picked up by other elements on the page thanks to the relative units.

size12, size14, and size16 are now functions that resize the body text to 12, 14, and 16 pixels, respectively. You can attach them to buttons as demonstrated in the following code example.
