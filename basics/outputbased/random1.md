    1.To understand the output of this code, it's important to comprehend the JavaScript event loop, along with how setTimeout, Promise, and microtasks work. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what happens when the code runs:

       1.console.log(1); is executed immediately in the main thread, printing 1.

       2.setTimeout(() => console.log(2)); schedules a macro task to print 2 after a delay of 0 milliseconds. This task will go into the task queue to be executed later.

       3.Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(3)); schedules a microtask to print 3. Microtasks are executed right after the currently executing script and before any task from the task queue.

       4.Promise.resolve().then(() => setTimeout(() => console.log(4))); schedules a microtask to set another macro task to print 4 after a delay of 0 milliseconds.

       5.Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(5)); schedules another microtask to print 5.

       6.setTimeout(() => console.log(6)); schedules a macro task to print 6 after a delay of 0 milliseconds.

       7.console.log(7); is executed immediately in the main thread, printing 7.

    2.Now, let's break down the order of execution:

      1.Main Thread Execution:

        console.log(1); → prints 1
        console.log(7); → prints 7
        Microtasks Execution (after the main thread):

        Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(3)); → prints 3
        Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(5)); → prints 5 
        Promise.resolve().then(() => setTimeout(() => console.log(4))); schedules another macro task to print 4.
      2.Macro Tasks Execution (after microtasks):

        setTimeout(() => console.log(2)); → prints 2
        setTimeout(() => console.log(6)); → prints 6
      3.The macro task scheduled by the microtask: setTimeout(() => console.log(4)); → prints 4

  1.Synchronous Code Execution:

    The code starts executing synchronously from the top.
    console.log(1); is called, which prints 1.
  2.Definition of Async Function:

    The async function foo is defined, but it is not yet executed.
  3.Execution of Async Function:

    foo(); is called, which starts executing the foo function.
    Inside foo, the first statement is console.log(2);, which prints 2.
  4.Awaiting a Promise:

    The next statement is await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));.
    A new promise is created, and setTimeout is called with a delay of 1000ms (1 second).
    The await keyword pauses the execution of the foo function until the promise is resolved. However, await only pauses the foo function, not the overall script. This means the execution continues to the next lines of code outside the foo function.
  5.Continuing Synchronous Code Execution:

    After calling foo();, the next line is console.log(4);, which prints 4.
  6.Timeout Completion and Promise Resolution:

    After approximately 1 second, the setTimeout callback executes, which calls resolve().
    This resolves the promise that was awaited in the foo function.
    The foo function resumes execution after the await line, and the next statement console.log(3); is executed, printing 3.
  7.Timeline of Execution
    console.log(1); prints 1.
    foo(); starts executing:
    console.log(2); inside foo prints 2.
    Execution pauses at await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));.
    console.log(4); prints 4.
    Approximately 1 second later:
    The promise inside foo is resolved, and foo resumes execution.
    console.log(3); inside foo prints 3.
